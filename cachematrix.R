## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your functions do: 
## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

## Write a short comment describing this function:
## makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix", which is really a list containing a function to
## set the value of the matrix
## get the value of the matrix
## set the value of the inverse
## get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
      m <- NULL
      set <- function(y) {
            x <<- y
            m <<- NULL
      }
      get <- function() x
      setsolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
      getsolve <- function() m
      list(set = set, get = get, setsolve = setsolve, getsolve = getsolve)
}

## Write a short comment describing this function:
## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" 
## created with the above function. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
## then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
      ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
      m <- x$getsolve()
      if(!is.null(m)) {
            message("getting cached data")
            return(m)
      }
      data <- x$get()
      m <- solve(data, ...)
      x$setsolve(m)
      m
